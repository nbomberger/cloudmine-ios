The following are issues known to us already and are planned to be resolved in the next release\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using a server-\/side code snippet and sending back J\-S\-O\-N objects without a {\ttfamily \-\_\-\-\_\-class\-\_\-\-\_\-} key currently does not work properly if using {\ttfamily C\-M\-Store}.
\item The {\ttfamily init\-With\-Coder\-:} and {\ttfamily encode\-With\-Coder\-:} methods are very boilerplatey and can easily be automated with a bit of runtime introspection.
\item There is no way to build a search query without learning the syntax yourself. There should be an object-\/oriented way to build these up.
\item Object graphs with complex relationships are not currently handled.
